# Exploit Research – Week 2 (Critical CVEs)

## Overview
This document contains exploit feasibility research for the Critical vulnerabilities discovered during Week 2 vulnerability assessment using OpenVAS (GVM).  
The goal is to validate whether public exploits exist and determine real-world attacker risk.

---

## Target Information
- **Target Host:** 192.168.186.129 (Metasploitable)
- **Scan Type:** Authenticated + Unauthenticated Scan
- **Tool Used:** OpenVAS / Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM)

---

## Critical Findings with Exploit Availability

| Vulnerability / Finding | CVSS | Exploit Availability | Public Sources | Exploit Type |
|-------------------------|------|----------------------|---------------|--------------|
| The rexec service is running | 10.0 | Likely Available | Metasploit / Legacy Unix Exploits | Remote Command Execution / Remote Login |
| rlogin Passwordless Login | 10.0 | Available | Metasploit / Legacy Trust Exploits | Authentication Bypass |
| Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb) Multiple RCE Vulnerabilities | 10.0 | Available | ExploitDB / GitHub PoC | Remote Code Execution |
| TWiki < 4.2.4 Multiple XSS / Command Execution Vulnerabilities | 10.0 | Available | ExploitDB / GitHub | XSS + Command Execution |
| Possible Backdoor: Ingreslock | 10.0 | Possible | GitHub / Security Blogs | Backdoor / Suspicious Service |
| Operating System (OS) End of Life (EOL) Detection | 10.0 | Not Applicable | Vendor Documentation | Risk due to unsupported OS |
| PHP < 5.3.13, 5.4.x < 5.4.3 Multiple Vulnerabilities (Active Check) | 9.8 | Available | ExploitDB / GitHub | RCE / Information Disclosure |
| Apache Tomcat AJP RCE Vulnerability (Ghostcat) (Active Check) | 9.8 | Available | ExploitDB / GitHub / Metasploit | File Read / Potential RCE |

## High-Risk Exploit Notes (Most Dangerous)

### 1) Apache Tomcat AJP RCE (Ghostcat)
- **CVSS:** 9.8 (Critical)
- **Why dangerous:** Exploitable remotely if AJP port is exposed.
- **Attacker outcome:** File read, credential disclosure, possible RCE.
- **Public exploit:** Widely available PoC on GitHub and ExploitDB.

---

### 2) Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb) RCE
- **CVSS:** 10.0 (Critical)
- **Why dangerous:** Remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary Ruby code.
- **Attacker outcome:** Full system compromise.
- **Public exploit:** Multiple PoCs exist.

---

### 3) TWiki < 4.2.4 Command Execution
- **CVSS:** 10.0 (Critical)
- **Why dangerous:** Old web application vulnerabilities are often easily exploitable.
- **Attacker outcome:** Remote command execution via web interface.
- **Public exploit:** ExploitDB and public writeups available.

---

## Exploit Validation Approach (Methodology)
The exploit research was performed using the following sources:
- ExploitDB
- GitHub Proof-of-Concept repositories
- Metasploit Framework modules
- Vendor advisories / security bulletins
- CVE databases

The purpose was to determine whether vulnerabilities are only theoretical or actively exploitable in real-world attack scenarios.

---

## Conclusion (Week 2 Exploit Readiness)
Most Critical findings identified in the OpenVAS scan have **public exploit availability**, meaning the target host is at immediate risk of compromise if exposed in production.

### Key Security Conclusion
- Services such as **rlogin** and **rexec** represent extremely high-risk legacy exposure.
- Web vulnerabilities like **TWiki** and **Tomcat Ghostcat** are realistic attack paths.
- EOL OS status increases long-term exposure because security patches are no longer supported.

---

## Next Step (Week 4 Remediation Planning)
These findings will be used to prioritize remediation actions:
- Disable insecure remote login services (rexec, rlogin)
- Patch vulnerable web services (Tomcat, PHP, TWiki)
- Apply CIS hardening controls
- Re-scan after remediation to confirm closure
